# Payroll
=======

All the PHP code is in the master folder

## Setup
### Required
* MySQL Server
* PHP Server (Apatche, perferably)

### PHP
PHP 7 required.
### MySQL
To configure the MySQL database connection, look at [master/resources/php/vars.php](https://github.com/TTWNO/payroll/blob/master/master/resouces/php/vars.php)

A Setup of MySQL Database is obviously required.

## How to use
Here are some links to the most important files:
* [master/index.php?n=Name of Person](https://github.com/TTWNO/payroll/blob/master/master/index.php) The place where people sign in and out.
* [master/stats/index.php](https://github.com/TTWNO/payroll/blob/master/master/stats/index.php) Check on people's stats here.

That's it, simple as that! :-)
